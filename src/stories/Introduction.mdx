# Lit Component Storybook

This Storybook mirrors the component authoring guide that lives in the repository. Each story renders the custom elements defined under `src/components/` so you can review styles, states, and layout permutations without wiring them into the demo pages first.

## Add a New Component Story

1. Create the component under `src/components/<feature>/` following the authoring guide.
2. Register the tag in `src/components/index.js` so the global entry can load it.
3. Add a matching story in `src/stories/<tag-name>.stories.js` and export at least one example. Use the existing stories as a template—return a custom element instance from the `render` function so properties and slots stay reactive.

## Design Tokens and Styling

- Global tokens live in `styles/global/base.css` and are already imported in the Storybook preview.
- Component-level styles should stay colocated with the component module. The stories only concern themselves with inputs (properties, attributes, slots).
- When you tweak tokens, re-run Storybook and the HTML demo to ensure both environments stay in sync.

## Manual Verification Checklist

- Interact with the controls panel to confirm each public property behaves as expected.
- Open the **Accessibility** and **Viewport** panels to test contrasted themes and responsive behavior.
- Note any gaps (TODOs, missing tokens, follow-up tasks) in your commit or handoff so the system stays traceable.
