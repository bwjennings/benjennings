          <h2 class="text-heading sm">Introduction</h2>
          <p class="text-body">
            Police Legal Sciences has provided forensic analysis and expert testimony
            for law enforcement agencies across the region for over two decades. Their
            reputation depends on precision, thoroughness, and the ability to communicate
            complex technical findings in court.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 class="text-heading sm">The problem</h2>
          <p class="text-body">
            With their growth, managing case files, chain of custody documentation, and
            evidence tracking became increasingly difficult. Their existing system required
            significant manual data entry and left room for critical errors. They needed
            a solution that could handle the complexity of their work without oversimplifying
            the process.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 class="text-heading sm">Content mapping</h2>
          <p class="text-body">
            We began by mapping every step of their forensic workflow, from initial evidence
            receipt through final report delivery. This revealed numerous decision points,
            regulatory requirements, and quality control checkpoints that couldn't be
            eliminated or simplified. The system needed to embrace this complexity, not
            hide from it.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 class="text-heading sm">Finding the right amount of complexity</h2>
          <p class="text-body">
            Rather than trying to make the interface "simple," we focused on making it
            clear and comprehensive. Each workflow step shows exactly what's required,
            why it matters, and what happens next. Context-sensitive help appears exactly
            when needed. The interface doesn't pretend the work is simple—it helps users
            navigate the necessary complexity with confidence.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 class="text-heading sm">Example of necessary complexity</h2>
          <p class="text-body">
            The chain of custody tracking includes detailed timestamps, handler information,
            storage conditions, and access logs. While this creates a dense interface,
            every field serves a legal and operational purpose. Our design organizes this
            information hierarchically and provides clear visual relationships between
            connected data points, making the complexity manageable without reducing it.
          </p>
        </div>

          <p class="text-body">
            This case study demonstrates how embracing necessary complexity can lead to
            more effective solutions than forced simplification. For more examples of
            complexity management in professional software, explore our other case studies
            and design patterns.
